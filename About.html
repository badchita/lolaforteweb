            </h2>
            <h3>
            Many of us know that Lola’s Forte is one of the oldest restaurant in the Philippines. With a history that
            took root in 1888 (Rizal was allegedly a customer) and a revamp in the 1980s after the original burned down,
            Lola’s Forte is a case study on lasting in the wild world called the restaurant industry. Its singular
            location has allowed the owners to focus their efforts on sustaining its legacy. But what about restaurants
            that have gone on to spawn branches in the country and the world over? The oldest food chains in the
            Philippines have shown how adaptibility and great business sense can help you not only thrive in the moment,
            but actually last. Tourist from all over the country or from outside of the country are really taking time
            to visit Lola’s Forte Restaurant. Luckily Lola’s Fortehas branches in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. There is
            no doubt that this restaurant will flourish for 100 and more years the secret for that is consistency.
            Consistency in service and most especially in their dishes. What people tasted from more than 100 years ago
            will be tasted by you and me and the future generations to come.
